# MorphoGBM v10 inference contract

This implementation was derived from the supplied resources rather than from
the removed legacy analysis stack.

## Runtime asset

The only deployed weight file is
`backend/models/morphogbm_v10_topology_robust_inference.pt` (SHA-256
`a729ecc0036ddb6a52819dc92e93be43bd18d2ce8d472179a9fb92f0a76aec7f`).
It embeds the exact ConvNeXt-Pico residual U-Net state, three-channel
normalization, and v10 calibration. The optimizer-bearing `*_last.pt`, the
A-region ablations, and the outer 680 MB archive are not runtime assets.

The v13 notebook's selected ensemble weight is `alpha = 0`, so its promoted
large-image result is the v10 teacher alone. No v13 student checkpoint is
required.

## Plane selection and MIP

- The request records an explicit zero-based model channel and current Z.
- A two-dimensional image uses that plane directly.
- A stack uses the supplied `nd2_mip_5z.py` shifted-window behavior: prefer two
  planes on either side, then shift inward at the first/last Z so a five-plane
  window is retained.
- A stack with fewer than five planes projects every available plane rather
  than failing. The actual inclusive/exclusive Z bounds and plane count are
  recorded as the exact Z-index list in the result.
- The same rule is used for TIFF and ND2. Other axes use the viewer's existing
  deterministic first-position/first-time policy.

## Contrast enhancement

The in-memory transform matches `image_enhance.py` as invoked by `apply_CE.py`:

1. cast the selected plane/MIP to `float32`;
2. compute its 1st and 99.7th percentiles;
3. linearly map those values to 0 and 255;
4. clip and cast to `uint8` using NumPy truncation.

The app adds one safety rule absent from the batch helper: a constant or invalid
percentile range returns an all-zero uint8 plane instead of dividing by zero.
The source array is never modified or saved over the original file.

## Model channels

The checkpoint divides the enhanced uint8 plane by 255, then forms:

```text
raw
log1p(9 * raw) / log(10)
sqrt(raw)
```

Those channels are standardized with the checkpoint's embedded mean and
standard deviation.

## Whole-image inference

The implementation follows the v13 notebook's final teacher path:

- 576 x 576 output cores;
- 32 pixels of observed/reflective halo on every side (640 x 640 model input);
- stride 288;
- eight D4 views (four rotations, with and without horizontal flip);
- sigmoid probabilities inverse-transformed and averaged;
- Gaussian overlap weights with sigma `0.25 * 576` and floor `0.05`;
- first/second-moment stitching for a disagreement summary;
- crop back to the exact source-plane dimensions.

Because halo inference changes the probability operating point, the final mask
uses the v13-selected eight-connected hysteresis rule, not the older patch-only
v10 threshold/component pair: low support `p >= 0.55`, high seeds `p >= 0.70`,
keep each low component containing at least one high seed.

## ROI thickness

Thickness mirrors
`interactive_qupath_gbm_mask_roi_thickness_colab.ipynb`:

1. skeletonize the complete predicted mask;
2. compute local diameter as twice the full-mask Euclidean distance-transform
   radius at each skeleton pixel;
3. select only skeleton samples inside the completed polygon ROI;
4. average those local diameters;
5. apply physical X/Y pixel calibration and divide by the linear expansion
   factor when expansion correction is enabled.

Endpoint, junction, border-component, sample-count, median, standard deviation,
and 5th/95th-percentile values are returned for quality control. The ROI is
transient viewer state and is not written into the user's annotations.

The viewer presents the observed (before-EF) average and the EF-adjusted
average together. The adjusted value is the primary result. Because the saved
measurement includes its pixel-domain mean diameter, both displayed values
respond immediately to the current image pixel-size and expansion-factor
settings without rerunning inference.

## Persistence and Z status

Queued, running, failed, and successful runs are stored in the analysis SQLite
database; masks and thickness geometry are stored under the configured
analysis state directory. Reopening an image or starting a new login restores
the latest valid prediction for every Z slice and resumes polling active runs.
The Z slider labels active slices as `Running` and completed slices as
`Segmented`. Restored masks are accepted only when the source file size and
nanosecond modification time still match the version used for inference.

Deleting a prediction for a Z slice removes all terminal run records and
artifacts for that slice so an older hidden mask cannot reappear. A queued or
running prediction cannot be deleted until it reaches a terminal state.

All model outputs and measurements are for research use only.
